# PatternFly Design Token Auditor & Bridge

Audit designs (from Figma or raw CSS) against the PatternFly token architecture. Bridge Figma style outputs to PatternFly 6 composite and semantic tokens.

For token categories, unit mappings, theme files, and pairing tables, see [token-reference.md](token-reference.md).

This skill specifies **what** a good audit delivers; it does not prescribe **how** to fetch Figma data, call APIs, or order tool use—use whatever your environment already exposes for Figma, docs, and code search.

## What a successful audit delivers

1. **Correct theme lens** — Judgments match the right PatternFly theme (default vs Red Hat, etc.); see Theme File Map in [token-reference.md](token-reference.md#theme-file-map).
2. **Defensible findings** — Each issue or pass ties to token semantics, cites descriptions where it matters, and names both Figma-side and CSS-side tokens when relevant.
3. **Navigable context** — For Figma-sourced work, the reader can **open the exact layer(s)** from the report (deep links; multi-node findings link every node).
4. **Honest gaps** — Unknowns and missing tokens are labeled as such, with escalation paths when there is no definition to apply.
5. **Optional Figma edits** — If the user opts in, the file afterward reflects **only** what they agreed to apply ([Applying changes in Figma](#applying-changes-in-figma-figma-use)).

## Inputs you must satisfy (outcomes)

**Theme:** Infer default vs Red Hat from brand accent when present: `#ee0000` → Red Hat; `#0066cc` → default upstream.

**Figma audits:** You can name layers, variables, and **stable node ids** for anything you cite; you can build correct file URLs (including branch files). Retain `fileKey` / branch key from the user’s link for deep links.

**CSS-only audits:** Interpret the values given; confirm theme/mode if ambiguous.

## Descriptions, classification, and naming

**Evidence:** Findings that recommend or reject a token should quote or paraphrase **official usage** from [PatternFly tokens](https://www.patternfly.org/tokens/all-patternfly-tokens) or project docs when that strengthens the verdict.

**Hierarchy:** Classify each property:

| Layer | Prefix Pattern | Verdict |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| Palette | `--pf-t--color--{hue}--{shade}` | REJECT |
| Base | `--pf-t--global--color--{concept}--{number}` | WARN |
| Semantic | `--pf-t--global--{concept}--color--{context}--{state}` | PASS |
| Component | `--pf-v6-c-{component}--{Property}` | PASS |
| Raw hex/rgb | `#abc123`, `rgb(...)` | REJECT |

**Naming shape:** Tokens are concept-based, never element-based (`font--size--heading--h1`, not `h1--font--size`). Full shape: `--pf-t--global--{concept}--{property}--{modifier}--{state}`.

## Judgment criteria (Rules 0–9)

#### Rule 0 — Prefer Purpose-Specific Semantic Tokens
Always cross-reference purpose-specific semantic tokens (see [token-reference.md](token-reference.md#purpose-specific-spacer-tokens)) before falling back to generic scale tokens. Purpose-specific tokens encode design intent and can be overridden independently.

- WRONG: `--pf-t--global--spacer--md` (generic)
- RIGHT: `--pf-t--global--spacer--gap--action-to-action--default` (purpose-specific)

#### Rule 1 — No Palette Tokens
Palette tokens are raw values. Always map to semantic equivalents.

#### Rule 2 — On-{Context} Foreground Matching
Foreground elements (text, icons) on a colored background must use `on-` tokens that exactly match the background context. Using `on-brand--default` on a `brand--accent` background is wrong — it may pass in one theme but fail in others. See the full pairing table in [token-reference.md](token-reference.md#on-context-foreground-pairing).

#### Rule 3 — Figma-to-CSS Unit Mapping
Figma outputs `px`; PatternFly CSS uses `rem` (font/icon/spacer/breakpoint) and unitless multipliers (line-height). Convert with `1rem = 16px`. Do NOT flag unit differences as value mismatches. Only two line-height tokens exist (`--body` = 1.5, `--heading` = 1.3). See mapping tables in [token-reference.md](token-reference.md#figma-to-css-unit-mapping).

#### Rule 4 — Composite Token Bridge
When Figma outputs individual shadow or glass properties, recommend the single composite token (`--box-shadow--sm/md/lg`, `--background--color--glass--primary--default`). See composites in [token-reference.md](token-reference.md#box-shadow-composites-in-tokens-localscss).

#### Rule 5 — Theme & collection awareness
**Outcome:** Judgments use the theme the design is actually using (collections, modes, brand accents)—not the wrong theme file. See Theme File Map in [token-reference.md](token-reference.md#theme-file-map).

#### Rule 6 — Contextual Token Pairing
Sibling properties (background, border, text, icon) on the same element should share the same context. If a context-specific token does not yet exist in CSS, flag as ESCALATION RECOMMENDED. See pairing table in [token-reference.md](token-reference.md#contextual-token-pairing).

#### Rule 7 — Figma-to-Code Drift Detection
When a Figma variable value differs from its CSS token value, do NOT treat as an error. Figma is the upstream source of truth. Flag as **SYNC REQUIRED** and report both values.

#### Rule 8 — Unbound Figma Properties
Hardcoded values not backed by a Figma variable need fixing in the Figma file. Only suggest semantic tokens as replacements — never base/numbered tokens. If no semantic token exists, state that explicitly and provide the closest matches.

#### Rule 9 — Component Implementation Cross-Check
When the design represents a known PatternFly component, compare the Figma token usage against the component's SCSS implementation. Flag differences as **IMPLEMENTATION DRIFT** — distinguish between likely errors and intentional design proposals. Include the component file path and selector for reference.

## Before escalating

**Outcome:** “No matching token” only after you have checked PatternFly token sources (e.g. `src/patternfly/base/tokens/` and component SCSS when available, plus docs)—so the gap is real, not a search miss.

## Report the user receives

**Outcome:** Someone reading the audit can **understand each verdict**, **trust the evidence**, **open the right Figma layers** (when applicable), and **act** on fixes without re-deriving context.

**Each finding should make clear:**

- **Status** — One of: VALIDATED, COMPOSITE FOUND, CONTEXT MISMATCH, IMPLEMENTATION DRIFT, SYNC REQUIRED, FIGMA FIX NEEDED, ESCALATION RECOMMENDED.
- **Where** — Layer name, node id(s), and an **Open in Figma** deep link to the **innermost** relevant node when the source is Figma ([link format](#figma-deep-links)).
- **What & why** — Property, current vs recommended mapping, short reason, and quoted or cited token **descriptions** when they carry the argument.
- **Visual grounding (issues)** — For non-passing Figma findings, include something that shows the problem (e.g. a crop or screenshot of that node)—enough that the issue is recognizable without opening the file.
- **Both names** — Figma variable path (or raw value) and CSS token where both exist.

### Finding table (expected shape)

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Layer | `{node name}` (`{node-id}`) — [Open in Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/{fileKey}/{fileSlug}?node-id={idWithHyphens}) |
| Property | `{css property}` |
| Current | `{Figma variable}` → `{CSS token}` |
| — description | *"{official usage description}"* |
| Recommended | `{correct token}` (if applicable) |
| — description | *"{description of recommended token}"* |
| Reason | `{brief explanation}` |

For **FIGMA FIX NEEDED**, the reader should also see what to bind, from what, and how to do it in plain language (Figma-variable slash path, not Plugin API).

### Multi-node (“Affected nodes”) findings

**Outcome:** If several layers share one finding, **every** listed node is one click from the report—no bare `1259:780` lists. Example: [`1259:780`](https://www.figma.com/design/{fileKey}/{fileSlug}?node-id=1259-780) (Primary Default text), [`1259:782`](https://www.figma.com/design/{fileKey}/{fileSlug}?node-id=1259-782) (Primary Hover text)—or one **Open in Figma** link per bullet line.

### Figma deep links

**Outcome:** Links open the **correct file and node** (including branch files).

Use `https://www.figma.com/design/{fileKey}/{fileSlug}?node-id={idWithHyphens}` where **`node-id` uses hyphens** (`41:7106` → `node-id=41-7106`). For `/design/.../branch/{branchKey}/...`, **`branchKey` is the `fileKey`**. Reuse the file slug from the user’s URL when you have it. Example: `[Open in Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/hIHHno4fZBKmTifVjuNqiz/Login-Screen---PatternFly?node-id=41-7106)` for node `41:7106`. If no stable node exists, omit the link and say why.

### Validated tokens summary

**Outcome:** Passes are listed in a compact table (property, Figma variable, CSS token, PASS). Add **Open in Figma** per row when a pass maps to a single identifiable node; skip the column when the pass is file-wide or aggregated.

## Optional: apply fixes in Figma

**Scope:** Only statuses with a direct Figma edit path—see mapping:

| Actionable Status | Intended result in the file |
|-------------------|------------------------------|
| FIGMA FIX NEEDED | Hardcoded value → recommended variable binding |
| CONTEXT MISMATCH | Property rebound to the correct semantic context |
| COMPOSITE FOUND | Primitives replaced by the composite token / variable |
| SYNC REQUIRED | Variable value aligned with the agreed source of truth |

VALIDATED, IMPLEMENTATION DRIFT, and ESCALATION RECOMMENDED are **out of scope** for file writes unless the user explicitly asks otherwise.

### User choice (outcomes)

**Outcome:** The user always has an **unambiguous** way to say: apply everything, walk item-by-item, skip, per-item apply / skip / apply-rest, or propose a **custom** fix for one item—without inferring intent from vague chat.

**Contract — stable ids** (map host pickers or numbered replies to behavior):

| Id (batch) | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| `update_all` | Apply every actionable finding |
| `update_individually` | Confirm each finding before it runs |
| `skip` | Change nothing in Figma |

| Id (per item) | Meaning |
|----------------|---------|
| `apply` | Apply the skill’s recommendation for this item |
| `provide_own` | User supplies an alternative; you confirm, then apply only that |
| `skip` | Leave this item unchanged |
| `apply_remaining` | Apply this item and all later items without further prompts |

**Outcome:** Prefer the host’s **structured choice** when it exists; otherwise offer **numbered replies** (`1`/`2`/`3` etc.) with the id mapping printed beside the numbers. Do not end with only informal bullets and no explicit mapping.

**Custom path (`provide_own`) outcome:** The user’s alternative is captured in chat, **restated as a one-line plan**, **explicitly confirmed**, then applied (or clarified if unsafe/ambiguous). The final summary marks those as **user-specified**.

### Applying changes in Figma (figma-use)

**Outcome:** The Figma file matches what the user **actually chose**—all, some, none, or a **confirmed** custom alternative. Skipped findings stay untouched.

**Delegation:** Performing edits belongs in the **`figma-use`** skill (how to drive the file, validate edits, and recover from errors). This auditor only supplies a **complete brief**: resolved apply-path ids, scope of findings to run now, and per-finding node ids, names, statuses, properties, and target bindings or values (including user-approved custom text for `provide_own`).

**After edits:** The user can see what landed, what did not, and what was never attempted—without this file duplicating Plugin API or script guidance.

### Post-application

**Outcome:** A short inventory—applied, skipped, failed (with enough to retry or fix manually)—so the session does not end ambiguously.

## Escalation

**Outcome:** If no PatternFly token fits, say so plainly and point to **community** ([PatternFly Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/patternfly/shared_invite/zt-3spaxzss2-w1PPDTgvqENVqNvhPDQP~w)) and **formal proposals** ([GitHub Token Proposal](https://github.com/patternfly/design-tokens/issues/new)) instead of inventing names in the audit.

## Where token definitions live (reference)

Token definitions live in `src/patternfly/base/tokens/`:
- `tokens-palette.scss` — raw color palette
- `tokens-default.scss` — light theme semantic tokens
- `tokens-local.scss` — composite tokens, glass composites
- `tokens-dark.scss`, `tokens-glass.scss`, `tokens-highcontrast.scss` — theme overrides

For the full token category reference, see [token-reference.md](token-reference.md).
