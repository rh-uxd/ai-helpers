# Migration to project-felt/ai-guidelines

**Date:** July 21, 2026  
**Branch:** `update-pf-ai-guide-to-project-felt`

## Changes

This skill has been updated to reference the **project-felt/ai-guidelines** repository instead of maintaining local copies of guidelines and reference images.

### What changed

**Before:**
- `guidelines/design-rules.md` — Local copy of detailed design rules
- `guidelines/reference-mapping.md` — Local reference image lookup tables
- `references/` — 25 local PNG/SVG reference images

**After:**
- SKILL.md now references content from [https://github.com/project-felt/ai-guidelines](https://github.com/project-felt/ai-guidelines)
- Content files: `content/*.md` (7 markdown files organized by topic)
- Images: `assets/images/` (60 reference images)
- Source: `source/ai-guidelines.txt` and `source/ai-guidelines.pdf`

### Why this change

1. **Single source of truth** — The project-felt/ai-guidelines repository is the authoritative source for Red Hat AI design guidelines
2. **Better organization** — Content is structured by topic (iconography, color, chatbot-avatars, etc.) instead of monolithic files
3. **More complete** — The repository includes 60 reference images vs the 25 we had locally
4. **Maintainability** — Updates to guidelines happen in one place, and the skill references them
5. **Transparency** — The repository includes the source deck (PDF and text) for full context

### Repository structure

### Content mapping

| Old file | New reference |
|----------|---------------|
| `guidelines/design-rules.md` | `content/iconography.md`, `content/chatbot-avatars.md`, `content/color.md`, `content/animation.md` |
| `guidelines/reference-mapping.md` | Direct references to `assets/images/*.png` paths in SKILL.md |
| `references/*.png` | `assets/images/*.png` (more complete set) |

### Old files removed

The `guidelines/` and `references/` directories have been removed as part of the completed migration. All content is now sourced from the project-felt/ai-guidelines repository.

## Usage changes

### For skill consumers

No changes needed! The skill behavior is identical. Reference images are now provided as GitHub URLs instead of local file paths.

### For skill contributors

When updating this skill:

1. **Check the source repository first:** [https://github.com/project-felt/ai-guidelines](https://github.com/project-felt/ai-guidelines)
2. **Run the check script:** `cd ~/ai-guidelines && ./check-source.sh` to see if the source deck has changed
3. **Update content files:** If the source changed, update `content/*.md` files following the pattern in the repository's CLAUDE.md
4. **Update SKILL.md:** Reference the new/updated content files and image paths

### For local development

Clone the ai-guidelines repository for local access to all content:

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/project-felt/ai-guidelines.git
```

The skill will reference the repository via GitHub URLs, but having a local copy helps when developing and testing updates.

## Validation

To validate the migration:

1. ✅ SKILL.md references all 9 AI icons by name
2. ✅ SKILL.md includes reference image paths for all major guidelines
3. ✅ Core principles, transparency requirements, and checklists are preserved
4. ✅ Review workflow and gradient sweep instructions are maintained
5. ✅ All external links updated to project-felt/ai-guidelines
6. ✅ Old `guidelines/` and `references/` directories removed
7. ✅ Image references validated against project-felt/ai-guidelines repository

## Next steps

1. Test the updated skill in a real design review scenario
2. Get feedback from skill users
3. Update plugin documentation if needed
