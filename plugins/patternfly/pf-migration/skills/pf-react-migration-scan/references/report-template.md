## Executive summary

[2–4 sentences: total findings, highest severity items, estimated migration effort]

| Severity | Count |

| Medium | [n] |

**Top actions:**

1. [Most urgent migration step]
2. [Second priority]

## Findings by severity

### Critical

[Omit section if none]

#### [Component or API change title]

- **Package:** `@patternfly/react-core`
- **Change type:** [removed component | removed prop | import path | …]
- **Documentation:** [link to upgrade guide, release notes, or PR]
- **Migration:** [what to do instead]

| File | Line | Current usage | Required change | Confidence |
|------|------|---------------|-----------------|------------|
| `src/...` | 42 | `<Chip>...</Chip>` | Replace with `<Label>` | high |

---

### High

[Same structure as Critical]

---

### Medium

[Same structure — typically deprecated imports still working via `/deprecated`]

---

## Findings by component

Alphabetical index for developers fixing one component at a time.

### [ComponentName]

**Breaking change:** [one-line description]

| File | Line | Issue | Fix |
|------|------|-------|-----|
| `src/...` | 10 | Uses removed prop `isActive` | Remove prop; visibility handled by parent |

---

## Packages affected

| Package | Installed version | Target version | Findings |
|---------|-------------------|----------------|----------|
| `@patternfly/react-core` | 5.4.0 | 6.3.0 | 12 |
| `@patternfly/react-table` | 5.4.0 | 6.3.0 | 3 |

## Recommended migration steps

1. [ ] Update `@patternfly/react-*` dependencies in `package.json`
2. [ ] Run `npx @patternfly/pf-codemods@latest --v6 <path>` (review before `--fix`)
3. [ ] Address Critical findings in [components/files]
4. [ ] Address High findings
5. [ ] Run build and tests; fix TypeScript errors from removed exports/props
6. [ ] Review Medium / deprecated usage for cleanup

---

## Out of scope (not included in this report)

This report covers **@patternfly/react-* API changes only**. The following were intentionally excluded:

- CSS class renames (`pf-v5-*` → `pf-v6-*`) — use `pf-css-migration-scan`
- Stylesheet CSS variable updates — use `pf-css-migration-scan` or css-vars codemods
- `@patternfly/chatbot` and other non-`react-*` packages
