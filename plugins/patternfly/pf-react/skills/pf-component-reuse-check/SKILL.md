# PF Component Reuse Check

Prefer existing PatternFly React components over custom ones that reinvent the same UI role.

## Scope — uncommitted changes only

Analyze **only** files that are newly created or currently modified and not yet committed. The user has already decided on committed code — do not scan or refactor it.

Identify scope with git:

```bash
git status --short
git diff --name-only HEAD
git ls-files --others --exclude-standard
```

Include:

- Modified tracked files (`M`, `A`, staged or unstaged)
- Untracked new files

Exclude:

- Unchanged committed files
- Deleted files (unless they only remove a custom component you are replacing)
- Generated/vendor directories (`node_modules`, `dist`, `build`, coverage)

If there is no git repo, ask the user which new/changed files to check. Never invent a whole-repo audit.

Limit analysis to component-relevant extensions: `.tsx`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, `.js` (and co-located styles only when tied to a candidate component).

## Workflow

Track progress:

```
- [ ] 1. Collect uncommitted candidates
- [ ] 2. Match against PatternFly React
- [ ] 3. Report suggestions (ask before replacing)
- [ ] 4. Replace (only if requested)
- [ ] 5. Build and verify
```

### 1. Collect uncommitted candidates

From scoped files, find **custom components** being introduced or substantially changed:

- Exported `function` / `const` components and default exports
- New JSX structures that implement a known UI role (button, modal, alert, table, tabs, empty state, form controls, etc.)
- Local wrappers that mostly re-skin or re-compose primitives into something PatternFly already ships

Skip:

- Components that already wrap/compose PatternFly correctly (thin app shells, domain layouts)
- Pure utility hooks, non-UI helpers, test fixtures
- Page/route containers whose job is orchestration, not a reusable UI control

For each candidate, capture: name, file path, props surface, and intended UI role (1 short sentence).

### 2. Match against PatternFly React

Use PatternFly documentation as the source of truth (PatternFly MCP when available; otherwise patternfly.org docs and package source/types):

1. Search docs with role keywords from the candidate (name, props, visual behavior). Try synonyms from [references/role-aliases.md](references/role-aliases.md).
2. For promising matches, verify schema, props, and examples to confirm API fit.
3. Prefer `@patternfly/react-core`, `@patternfly/react-table`, `@patternfly/react-charts`, `@patternfly/chatbot`, and `@patternfly/react-component-groups` as appropriate.

Match confidence:

| Level | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| High | Same UI role and enough prop coverage to replace without inventing a new abstraction |
| Medium | Same role, but some custom behavior needs PatternFly props, composition, or a small wrapper |
| Low | Related family only — mention as optional alternative, do not push replacement |

Do not suggest a match on name similarity alone. Confirm role + interaction model from docs/examples.

### 3. Report suggestions

For each High/Medium match, present before changing anything:

```
### [ComponentName] → PatternFly [PFComponent]

- File: path/to/file.tsx
- Confidence: High | Medium
- Why: <one sentence on overlapping role>
- Import: `import { PFComponent } from '@patternfly/...'`
- Docs: <patternfly.org or MCP docs link when available>
- Gaps: <custom behavior not covered, or "none">

Replace with PatternFly? (yes / no / adjust)
```

End with a short summary: candidates checked, matches found, no-match custom components kept.

If no matches: say so briefly and stop. Do not force PatternFly onto domain-specific UI.

### 4. Replace (only when the user asks)

When the user confirms replacement (or says to replace / use PatternFly instead):

1. Replace custom component usage with the PatternFly component API from docs/examples.
2. Map props intentionally; do not invent unsupported props.
3. Add or fix imports (follow `pf-import-check` rules for charts, chatbot, component-groups).
4. Remove the custom component definition and dead exports when fully replaced.
5. Update call sites in **scoped** files. If a committed file still imports the removed custom component, report it and ask before editing outside scope.
6. For Medium confidence, prefer PatternFly composition first; keep a thin wrapper only if truly required, and say why.

### 5. Build and verify

After replacement:

1. Detect the package manager (`package-lock.json` → npm, `yarn.lock` → yarn, `pnpm-lock.yaml` → pnpm).
2. Ensure required `@patternfly/*` dependencies exist; install only what the replacement needs.
3. Run the project's build script from `package.json` (`build`, else `compile` / `tsc` as available).

```bash
# examples — use the project's actual scripts
npm run build
# or: yarn build | pnpm run build
```

4. If the build fails due to the replacement, fix those errors and rebuild.
5. Report: build command used, pass/fail, files changed, remaining gaps.

Do not claim success without a successful build (or a clear blocker outside the replacement, such as pre-existing project failures — distinguish those).

## Guardrails

- Never expand the audit into committed, untouched components.
- Never replace without an explicit user yes (or an explicit “replace with PatternFly” request in the prompt).
- Never invent PatternFly APIs — confirm with docs/schemas (MCP when available).
- Prefer one clear PatternFly component (or standard composition) over a large custom rewrite.
- If PatternFly coverage is incomplete, recommend keep-custom or hybrid and explain the gap.
