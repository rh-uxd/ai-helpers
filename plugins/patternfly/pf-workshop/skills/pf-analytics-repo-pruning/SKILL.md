# Analytics repo pruning

Keep PatternFly Analytics from tracking **archived** repositories and repos with **no meaningful code activity** past a configurable threshold (default **730 days**).

## Plugin placement

This skill lives under **pf-workshop** as **cross-repo / analytics inventory** work (repo health and maintenance).

## Input

- **File:** `repos.json` (project root or path the user supplies). Expect a top-level `repos` array; each entry has `git` (clone URL) and `name` (display label).

## Outcomes

For every row, assign one bucket:

| Bucket | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **archived** | Host marks the project archived / read-only |
| **stale** | Last code activity is before the cutoff |
| **could not verify** | Auth failure, network, or unsupported host—**not** the same as stale |
| **active** | Neither archived nor stale |

Use the host’s best signal for **real code activity** (e.g. last push to the default branch), not noisy metadata-only updates. Field names and API notes: [reference.md](reference.md).

## How to work

1. Read `repos.json` and collect all `git` URLs with their `name`.
2. For each URL, determine host (**GitHub**, **GitLab** including private instances, or other).
3. Query the host using **whatever authenticated access the user’s environment already provides** (host CLI, REST with tokens, etc.). Prefer a deterministic per-repo lookup; if one path fails, try another before giving up.
4. Do **not** treat auth or network failures as “stale”—bucket those as **could not verify** with a short reason.
5. Produce the report below. **Do not** remove or edit `repos.json` entries unless the user explicitly asks.

## Edge cases

- **404 / moved / renamed:** Flag for manual verification; do not assume delete.
- **Forks and mirrors:** Same rules; stale mirrors may still be poor analytics targets.
- **Unknown hosts:** **could not verify** with explanation—not stale.

## Optional script

For a repeatable local run, execute the bundled **Bash** script `scripts/analytics-repo-pruning.sh` next to this skill. Requires `jq` and either `gh` or `curl` (typically pre-installed). Pass the path to `repos.json`; optional `--days <n>` and `--json`. Does not modify `repos.json`.

## Report format

Use markdown with:

1. **Threshold** (days) and **run date**
2. **Archived** — table: name, git, notes
3. **Stale** — table: name, git, last activity (and which field was used)
4. **Could not verify** — table: name, git, reason
5. **Active** — brief count or one-line summary

**Good output:** Clear buckets, honest “unknown,” timestamps tied to named fields, no silent edits to the JSON file.

**Bad output:** Calling repos stale because API calls failed, or pruning the list without explicit user consent.
