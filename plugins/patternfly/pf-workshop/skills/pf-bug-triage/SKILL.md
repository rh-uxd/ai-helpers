# Bug Triage

Performs preliminary triage of opened issues labeled as bugs. Produces a structured triage summary with fix suggestions and maintainer recommendations.

## Input

The user provides an issue (title, body, labels, and optionally linked files or component names). The issue must be marked or labeled as a bug.

## Triage Workflow

### 1. Parse the Issue

Extract from the issue:
- **Summary** — One-sentence description of the bug
- **Reproduction steps** — Are they clear and complete?
- **Expected vs actual behavior** — Is the distinction stated?
- **Environment** — Versions, browser, OS if mentioned
- **Affected area** — Component, file path, or feature inferred from description

### 2. Assess Completeness

Flag if missing:
- [ ] Reproduction steps
- [ ] Expected vs actual behavior
- [ ] Version/environment info
- [ ] Minimal reproduction (code, sandbox, or repo link)

Suggest what the reporter should add before the issue can be triaged effectively.

### 3. Identify Fix Location

Search the codebase for:
- Component names, file paths, or imports mentioned in the issue
- Related code in `packages/`, `src/`, or equivalent
- Tests that might need updates
- Documentation that might be wrong

Suggest **what needs to be updated** to fix the bug:
- Specific files or components
- Likely root cause (logic, styling, accessibility, API usage)
- Tests to add or modify
- Any docs to update

### 4. Determine Maintainer

Find the most appropriate maintainer to tag when the issue **contains questions** (e.g., "Is this expected?", "How should we handle X?"):

1. **Check CODEOWNERS** — If present, match issue paths to ownership:
   - Map affected files/components to CODEOWNERS entries
   - Tag the owner(s) for the most relevant path(s)

2. **Check CONTRIBUTING.md / MAINTAINERS** — Look for maintainer lists, areas of responsibility, or "who to ask" sections.

3. **Infer from codebase** — If no CODEOWNERS:
   - Recent commits to affected files
   - Component/package naming (e.g., `packages/react-table` → table maintainers)
   - Comments or author info in relevant files

4. **Fallback** — If unclear, suggest: "Tag @patternfly/react-core-maintainers" or the repo's default maintainer group.

**Only suggest tagging when the issue explicitly asks a question** that requires maintainer input. Do not tag for straightforward bugs that just need implementation.

For CODEOWNERS format and when-to-tag guidance, see [reference.md](reference.md).

## Output Format

Produce a triage comment or summary using this template:

```markdown
## Bug Triage Summary

### Summary
[One-sentence bug description]

### Completeness
- [ ] Reproduction steps clear
- [ ] Expected vs actual stated
- [ ] Environment/versions provided
- [ ] Minimal reproduction available

[If incomplete: List what the reporter should add]

### Suggested Fix
**Likely location:** [files, components, or packages]
**Root cause:** [brief hypothesis]
**Changes needed:**
- [ ] [Specific change 1]
- [ ] [Specific change 2]
- [ ] [Tests to add/modify]
- [ ] [Docs to update if applicable]

### Context for Assignee
[2–4 bullets: key files to look at, related patterns, similar past fixes, or docs to reference]

### Maintainer Tag (if issue has questions)
**Suggested:** @[username or team]
**Reason:** [Why this maintainer — e.g., "Owns Table component per CODEOWNERS"]
```

## Rules

- Be concise. Each section should be 1–3 sentences or bullets.
- Only suggest maintainer tags when the issue **asks a question** requiring maintainer input.
- If the codebase is unavailable, state what you would search for and produce a partial triage.
- Use the repo's actual structure (e.g., `packages/react-core`, `packages/react-table`) when suggesting locations.
