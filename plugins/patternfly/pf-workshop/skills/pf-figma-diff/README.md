# Figma Design Change Tracker Skill

Track Figma design updates and maintain alignment between design and code.

## What This Skill Does

This skill helps you:
- 📊 Track changes in Figma design files
- 📝 Generate comprehensive changelogs with timestamps and authors
- 🔍 Compare Figma design tokens with your codebase
- ✅ Create actionable checklists for code updates
- 🎨 Identify token discrepancies between design and implementation

## When to Use

The skill automatically triggers when you:
- Ask to "check Figma updates"
- Want to "compare Figma with code"
- Need to "audit design tokens"
- Mention "design system updates"
- Discuss "sync design and code"

## Quick Start

1. **Get your Figma access token** (optional but recommended):
   - Go to https://www.figma.com/developers/api#access-tokens
   - Generate a personal access token
   - Store it: `export FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN="your-token"`

2. **Have your Figma file URL ready**:
   ```
   https://www.figma.com/file/ABC123/My-Design-System
   ```

3. **Ask Claude**:
   ```
   Check for Figma updates and compare with our code
   ```

## Example Workflows

### Track Recent Changes
```
What changed in our Figma design system in the last week?
```

### Compare Specific Component
```
Compare the Button component in Figma with our code implementation
```

### Audit Design Tokens
```
Audit all color tokens - are they in sync with Figma?
```

### Generate Update Checklist
```
What code changes do we need to match the latest Figma designs?
```

## Output Format

The skill generates:

1. **Executive Summary**: Overview of changes
2. **Detailed Changelog**: Component-by-component breakdown
3. **Token Comparison Table**: Figma vs Code values
4. **Action Items Checklist**: Prioritized updates with file paths
5. **Next Steps**: Recommendations

- `references/` - Report templates and API guides
- `scripts/extract-figma-file-key.sh` - Extract file key from URL
- `scripts/compare-tokens.sh` - Automated token comparison (with Node.js validation)
- `scripts/compare-tokens.js` - Token comparison implementation

## Configuration

### Token Directory
Default: `src/patternfly/base/tokens`

If your tokens are elsewhere, just mention it:
```
My tokens are in src/styles/tokens
```

### Token Formats Supported
- SCSS variables (`$color-primary`)
- CSS custom properties (`--pf-global--color`)
- JSON token files
- JavaScript/TypeScript exports

## Tips

- Run checks weekly to catch changes early
- Keep a mapping between Figma frames and code components
- Tag code releases with corresponding Figma version
- Share reports with both design and dev teams

## Troubleshooting

**"Can't access Figma file"**
- File might be private - provide access token
- Check file URL is correct
- Ensure you have view permissions

**"Token files not found"**
- Specify correct token directory path
- Check if tokens are in node_modules (PatternFly packages)

**"No recent changes detected"**
- Verify date range
- Check if you're looking at the right file
- Figma version history requires authentication

## FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: Should designers run this or developers?**
A: Both! Designers can verify their changes landed correctly in code, and developers can check what needs updating. The skill is designed to bridge the design-development gap.

**Q: How often should we sync?**
A: Weekly for active projects with frequent design changes, bi-weekly for stable projects. Consider running it before each sprint planning session.

**Q: What if the token names don't match between Figma and code?**
A: Create a token mapping file (see `examples/token-mappings.json`) to define relationships between Figma names and code token names. This enables fuzzy matching.

**Q: Does this work with Figma Variables or just Styles?**
A: Currently optimized for Styles. Figma Variables support can be added - check the Figma API endpoint `/files/{key}/variables/local`.

**Q: Can this work with other design systems besides PatternFly?**
A: Yes! Just update the token directory paths and naming conventions. The core workflow is design-system agnostic.

### Workflow Questions

**Q: Who should approve the generated reports?**
A: Ideally, a cross-functional review: design lead validates design accuracy, tech lead validates code feasibility, product manager prioritizes updates.

**Q: Should we commit the generated reports to git?**
A: Yes for FIGMA_CHANGELOG.md and RELEASE_NOTES.md (team documentation). The detailed update checklist (figma-updates-*.md) can be gitignored if it's task-specific.

**Q: What if we use a monorepo?**
A: Run the sync from your package directory or specify full paths to token directories. See [troubleshooting.md](references/troubleshooting.md) for monorepo examples.

**Q: Can we automate this in CI/CD?**
A: Yes! You can create a GitHub Action that runs weekly and creates a PR with the sync results.

### Technical Questions

**Q: What Node.js version is required?**
A: Node.js 14+ is recommended. The scripts use standard ES6+ features without exotic dependencies.

**Q: Does this modify our code automatically?**
A: No. This is a reporting tool only. It generates checklists and recommendations but never modifies code files automatically.

**Q: How do we handle responsive values (mobile/tablet/desktop)?**
A: Figma may store these as variants or separate frames. Document the mapping in your token-mappings.json, or process each breakpoint separately.

**Q: What about dark mode / theme variations?**
A: If Figma uses Variables with modes (themes), you can fetch them via the variables endpoint. Otherwise, treat each theme as a separate component variant.

**Q: Can we ignore certain Figma changes?**
A: Yes. Use the ignoreList in token-mappings.json to exclude internal/debug tokens, or filter by component in your sync command.

### Troubleshooting

**Q: I'm getting "401 Unauthorized" errors**
A: Your Figma access token is missing or invalid. Generate a new personal access token at https://www.figma.com/developers/api#access-tokens and set it: `export FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN="your-token"`

**Q: "No tokens found in code" error**
A: Verify your tokens directory path is correct and contains .scss/.css files. For PatternFly, try `./src/patternfly/base/tokens/` or `./node_modules/@patternfly/patternfly/base/`.

**Q: The script finds tokens but they're all mismatches**
A: This usually means naming conventions differ. Create a token-mappings.json file to map Figma names to code names. See examples/ directory.

**Q: Version history is empty**
A: You may need editor access (not just viewer) to see version history. Ask the file owner to grant you edit permissions or use OAuth for broader access.
