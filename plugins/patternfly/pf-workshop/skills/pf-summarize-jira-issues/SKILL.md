# Summarize My Jira Issues

Fetch sprint issues assigned to or contributed by the current user, summarize the workload, and provide prioritization recommendations.

## Workflow

1. **Get user identity** - Identify the current user's Jira account
2. **Fetch sprint issues** - Query active sprint items (assigned + contributing)
3. **Fetch contributor issues** - Query issues where user is listed as contributor
4. **Analyze workload** - Categorize by sprint commitment vs contributions
5. **Generate summary** - Present sprint-focused overview with recommendations

## Step 1: Get User Identity

Identify the current user's Atlassian account and accessible Jira resources (account ID and cloud ID).

## Step 2: Fetch Sprint Issues

Run these queries in parallel via the Atlassian MCP:

**Active sprint issues assigned to user** (open statuses, ordered by priority then status):
```jql
assignee = currentUser() AND sprint in openSprints() AND status NOT IN (Done, Closed, Resolved) ORDER BY priority DESC, status ASC
```

**Sprint issues completed this sprint** (most recently resolved first):
```jql
assignee = currentUser() AND sprint in openSprints() AND status IN (Done, Closed, Resolved) ORDER BY resolved DESC
```

## Step 3: Fetch Contributor Issues

Query issues where the user is a contributor but not the assignee. Run in parallel with sprint queries.

```jql
"Contributor[User Picker (multiple users)]" = currentUser() AND assignee != currentUser() AND status NOT IN (Done, Closed, Resolved) ORDER BY priority DESC, updated DESC
```

**Note:** The contributor field name varies by Jira instance. Common alternatives: `"Contributors"`, `cf[XXXXX]`. If the query fails, try alternate field names or ask the user.

## Step 4: Fetch Backlog (Brief)

Fetch a brief backlog summary — sprint work takes priority. Limit to ~10 results.

```jql
assignee = currentUser() AND (sprint is EMPTY OR sprint not in openSprints()) AND status NOT IN (Done, Closed, Resolved) ORDER BY priority DESC, updated DESC
```

## Step 5: Analyze Workload

### Sprint Focus

The primary analysis should be on sprint items:

| Category | Criteria | Action |
|----------|----------|--------|
| 🔴 **Sprint - In Progress** | Active sprint items being worked on | Complete these first |
| 🟡 **Sprint - To Do** | Sprint items not yet started | Start after in-progress items |
| 🟢 **Sprint - Done** | Completed this sprint | Track velocity |

### Contributor Analysis

For issues where user is a contributor:

| Category | Criteria | Action |
|----------|----------|--------|
| 👥 **Active Contributions** | In Progress items you're helping with | May need your input |
| 📋 **Pending Contributions** | To Do items you'll contribute to | Plan for upcoming work |

### Backlog (Brief)

Only highlight backlog items that are:
- High priority and may need sprint inclusion
- Blocked or stale and need attention
- Quick wins that could be done if sprint work completes early

## Step 6: Generate Summary

Present findings using this sprint-focused structure.

## 🎯 Your Sprint Commitment

### In Progress
[List sprint items currently being worked on]

| Issue | Summary | Status | Updated |
|-------|---------|--------|---------|
| PROJ-123 | [summary] | In Progress | Today |

### To Do
[List sprint items not yet started]

| Issue | Summary | Priority |
|-------|---------|----------|
| PROJ-456 | [summary] | High |

### ✅ Completed This Sprint
[Brief list of completed sprint work]

- PROJ-111: [summary]
- PROJ-222: [summary]

## 👥 Contributing To

Issues where you're listed as a contributor (owned by others):

| Issue | Summary | Owner | Status | Updated |
|-------|---------|-------|--------|---------|
| PROJ-789 | [summary] | @owner | In Progress | Yesterday |

**Action needed:** [Note any contributor items that may need your input soon]

## 📋 Backlog Highlights

[Only show if relevant - keep brief]

**[count] items in backlog** (not in current sprint)

Notable items:
- [Any high priority items that might need sprint inclusion]
- [Any blocked items needing attention]

---

## Recommended Focus Order

1. **Now:** [Most urgent sprint item]
2. **Next:** [Second priority]
3. **Watch:** [Contributor items that may need input]
```

## Tips for Quality Summaries

**Sprint first:**
- Always lead with sprint commitment
- Sprint items are the primary deliverables
- Backlog is secondary context only

**Contributor awareness:**
- Highlight contributor items that are "In Progress" - you may be needed
- Note who owns each contributor issue
- Flag if contributor items are blocked waiting on you

**Keep backlog brief:**
- Only show top 5-10 backlog items
- Focus on items that might need sprint inclusion
- Don't overwhelm with full backlog listing

**Adapt to sprint state:**
- Early sprint: Focus on planning and getting started
- Mid sprint: Focus on progress and blockers
- Late sprint: Focus on completion and carryover risk

## Example Queries

**All sprint issues (any status):**
```jql
assignee = currentUser() AND sprint in openSprints()
```

**Sprint items at risk (not started, sprint half over):**
```jql
assignee = currentUser() AND sprint in openSprints() AND status = "To Do"
```

**Contributor issues in progress:**
```jql
"Contributor[User Picker (multiple users)]" = currentUser() AND status = "In Progress"
```

**Contributor issues updated recently:**
```jql
"Contributor[User Picker (multiple users)]" = currentUser() AND updated >= -3d
```

**High-priority backlog (not in sprint):**
```jql
assignee = currentUser() AND sprint is EMPTY AND priority IN (Highest, High) AND status NOT IN (Done, Closed, Resolved)
```

**Backlog items not updated in 30 days:**
```jql
assignee = currentUser() AND sprint is EMPTY AND updated < -30d AND status NOT IN (Done, Closed, Resolved)
```
