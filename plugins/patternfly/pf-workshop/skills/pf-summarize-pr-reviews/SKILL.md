# Summarize My PR Review Queue

Fetch all GitHub pull requests where the current user is requested as a reviewer, summarize the changes, and provide prioritization recommendations.

## Workflow

1. **Get user identity** - Identify the current GitHub user
2. **Search for review requests** - Query GitHub for PRs requesting the user's review
3. **Fetch PR details** - Get diff stats, reviews, CI status, and context for each PR
4. **Analyze and categorize** - Size, priority, and complexity assessment
5. **Generate summary** - Present a clear overview with prioritization recommendations

## Step 1: Get User Identity

Identify the authenticated GitHub user's login.

## Step 2: Search for PRs Requesting Review

Search for open PRs where the user is requested as a reviewer, sorted by most recently updated. Run both queries in parallel:

- **Primary:** Open PRs awaiting your review
- **Secondary:** Open PRs you've already reviewed but haven't approved (may have new changes)

If the user asks about a specific org or repo, scope the search accordingly.

## Step 3: Fetch PR Details

For each PR found, fetch in parallel: metadata (title, author, labels, created date), files changed (count, lines added/deleted, key paths), existing reviews and their states, and CI/check status.

Extract from each PR:
- Title and description
- Author
- Number of files changed, lines added/deleted
- Labels (especially priority, urgent, blocker, critical)
- How long it's been open
- CI/check status (passing, failing, pending)
- Existing reviews and their states (approved, changes requested, commented)

## Step 4: Analyze and Categorize

### Size Categories

| Size | Criteria | Review Time Estimate |
|------|----------|---------------------|
| 🟢 **Small** | <100 lines changed, <5 files | ~10-15 min |
| 🟡 **Medium** | 100-500 lines, 5-15 files | ~30-60 min |
| 🔴 **Large** | >500 lines or >15 files | 1+ hours |

### Priority Signals

Flag PRs as high-priority when:
- Labeled `priority`, `urgent`, `blocker`, or `critical`
- Open >3 days without any review
- Author has pinged or requested re-review
- Blocking other work (mentioned in description)
- Failing CI that needs investigation
- Security fix or hotfix

### Complexity Indicators

Note when PRs involve:
- Multiple reviewers requested
- Files spread across different areas of the codebase
- New dependencies added
- Database migrations or API changes
- Configuration or infrastructure changes

## Step 5: Generate Summary

Structure the output in this order. Adapt detail level to queue size: full detail for <5 PRs, grouped summaries for 5-15, top priorities only for >15.

### At a Glance

Open with a quick snapshot:
- Total PRs awaiting review
- Breakdown by size (small / medium / large)
- Oldest PR waiting

### Priority Reviews (Address First)

Table of PRs that are urgent, stale (>3 days without review), security/hotfix, or blocking others. Include a "Why Priority" column.

For each priority PR, provide a detail block:
- **Repository** and **Author**
- **Changes:** `+X/-Y` lines across N files
- **Summary of Changes:** Brief description from title, description, and files changed
- **Key files to review:** Top 2-3 files with brief explanation
- **Review notes:** CI failures, existing review comments, blockers

### Standard Reviews

Remaining PRs in suggested review order. Table with PR number, repo, author, size, wait time, and notes. Detail blocks for each.

### Quick Reviews (Small PRs)

Compact table of small PRs that can be knocked out quickly — good for short time blocks.

### Needs Attention

Flag concerning patterns:
- **Stale PRs:** Open >7 days without review
- **Failed CI:** PRs with failing checks
- **Re-review requested:** PRs you reviewed but have new commits

### Suggested Review Order

Numbered list combining priority, size, and wait time into a recommended sequence. End with an estimated total review time.

## Tips for Quality Summaries

**Understand the changes:**
- Read the PR description carefully
- Look at file types changed to understand scope
- Note if tests are included

**Identify what matters:**
- Focus on the "why" not just the "what"
- Highlight breaking changes or API modifications
- Note new dependencies or configuration changes

**Make it actionable:**
- Suggest a specific review order
- Estimate review time for planning
- Flag PRs that can be quick wins

**Provide context:**
- Link directly to each PR with full URL
- Show how long PRs have been waiting
- Note if CI is passing/failing

**Adapt to queue size:**
- For <5 PRs: Detailed summary of each
- For 5-15 PRs: Group by priority, summarize key points
- For >15 PRs: Focus on top priorities, list others briefly
